<h2>Project</h2>

<strong>
    <p class="text"> 
        The analysis of health data plays a crucial role in medical research and enables 
        more precise diagnoses, more effective treatments and future-oriented care. 
        However, given the sensitivity of such data, careful handling is essential to 
        ensure both legal requirements and the protection of patient privacy. This 
        challenge is particularly evident in the context of training artificial 
        intelligence (AI) models, where extensive data sets are necessary to obtain 
        reliable results.

    on the left are several nodes of a decentralized analysis, while on the right the 
    data streams flow to a central location.

<p class="text">
    The PrivateAIM (Privacy-preserving Analytics in Medicine) method platform addresses 
    precisely this interface and attempts to pave a balanced path between data protection 
    and data use. It follows the principle of 'code to the data', in which the health data 
    remain in the protected environments of the university hospitals and only the analysis 
    algorithms are exchanged. This form of decentralized analysis ensures that data never 
    leaves its secure environment. Patients' identities and sensitive health information 
    thus remain fully protected and cannot be viewed by researchers at any time.

    To achieve this goal, the PrivateAIM project is dedicated to developing customized AI 
    methods, risk models and federation mechanisms. These innovations are incorporated into 
    the newly developed software platform FLAME (Federated Learning and Analysis in Medicine) 
    and thus form the technological core for secure, distributed evaluations in the Medical 
    Informatics Initiative (MII).

    The PrivateAIM consortium brings together a variety of experts from university medicine 
    and other institutions. A total of 17 partners from all four MII consortia, including 
    three MII-funded junior research groups, are involved in the project. Special emphasis 
    is placed on the active involvement of patients and other stakeholders to bring 
    multi-layered perspectives to the project.

    The consortium is working hard to explain the technical procedures for privacy-compliant 
    federated evaluations and machine learning (ML) to citizens in a comprehensible way. 
    The goal is to communicate the security guarantees and protection that these methods 
    offer in a transparent and comprehensible manner. To this end, patients and the general 
    public are educated about PrivateAIM's work through easy-to-understand information materials. 
    In addition, patients and other stakeholders will be involved in workshops from the outset 
    to actively shape the design, implementation, and evaluation of privacy-friendly federated 
    methods.

    Before the results of the project are put into practice, FLAME will be put through its 
    paces both with benchmark data sets and in real applications. Broad acceptance is targeted 
    through a multi-stage rollout concept involving the data integration centers of all MII consortia. 
    The provision as open source software and the cooperation with related projects contribute 
    significantly to the sustainability of the project.

    Over the next four years, the PrivateAIM method platform with FLAME in the MII will offer an 
    additional possibility to analyze medical data efficiently and securely across locations. 
    Especially for modern AI methods, this will open up the urgently needed extensive data volumes 
    without neglecting the central aspect of data protection for patients.
